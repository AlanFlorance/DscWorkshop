# Infrastructure Pipeline

This part of the workshop tries to solve (or highlight) different problems usually found in production environments.

1. The [Release Pipeline Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mFk3Oxdiwc)

2. The [DSC Configuration Data Problem](https://gaelcolas.com/2018/01/29/the-dsc-configuration-data-problem/)

2. [Composing Roles and Configurations](https://gaelcolas.com/2018/02/07/composing-dsc-roles/), DRY (Don't repeat Yourself)

3. [Splatting DSC Resources](https://gaelcolas.com/2017/11/05/pseudo-splatting-dsc-resources/)


## Composing Roles and Configurations

### First Step

The first step to kick off a build of the DSC Artefacts is to run this command:

```PowerShell
C:\> .build.ps1 -ResolveDependency
```

This will pull all the dependencies from the PowerShell Gallery and save them in your project (but not in the `git` repository).

This will take some time, but when working on your workstation you don't need to pull everytime (only when you change one of the PSDepend definition files).

Have a look at what is pulled here:
- [Modules used during the Build process](./PSDepend.build.psd1)
- [Modules containing the DSC Configurations (DSC Composite Resource)](./PSDepend.DSC_Configurations.psd1)
- [Modules containing the DSC Resources](./PSDepend.DSC_Resources.psd1)
