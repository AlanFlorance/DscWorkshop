# DSC Workshop Overview

## Goal:
  - Introduction to the [Release Pipeline Model](https://aka.ms/TRPM) and one possible implementation using DSC
  - Takeaway code to setup a lab environment at work/home, to learn how to roll your own DSC Pipeline
  - Share our experience of rolling out DSC at scale in Production environment, in highly regulated industries 



## Overview:

1. Introduction
2. [AutomatedLab](https://youtu.be/lrPlRvFR5fA) and Existing Infrastructure
3. The Release [Pipeline](https://gaelcolas.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/samplemodule_pipeline.mp4), and how to apply to your [infrastructure](https://gaelcolas.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/demo_dsc_sol.mp4)
4. Building a trusted release process 
5. Bringing Existing Infrastructure under DSC Control, with [Datum](https://gaelcolas.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/datum_quick.mp4)


## How to code along with this Lab

You can do the following:
- Follow with the full Lab, setting up your lab VMs with AutomatedLab. Deploying required services (AD, SQL, TFS...), and allow you to experiment with a typical infrastructure

- Only Play with the DSC Side locally on your machine, creating roles, Nodes, and compiling artefacts
