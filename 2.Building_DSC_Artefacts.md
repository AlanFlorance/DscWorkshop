# Infrastructure Pipeline

This part of the workshop tries to solve (or highlight) different problems usually found in production environments.

1. The [Release Pipeline Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mFk3Oxdiwc)

2. The [DSC Configuration Data Problem](https://gaelcolas.com/2018/01/29/the-dsc-configuration-data-problem/)

2. [Composing Roles and Configurations](https://gaelcolas.com/2018/02/07/composing-dsc-roles/), DRY (Don't repeat Yourself)

3. [Splatting DSC Resources](https://gaelcolas.com/2017/11/05/pseudo-splatting-dsc-resources/)


## Composing Roles and Configurations

### First Step

The first step to kick off a build of the DSC Artefacts is to run this command:

```PowerShell
C:\> .build.ps1 -ResolveDependency
```

This will pull all the dependencies from the PowerShell Gallery and save them in your project (but not in the `git` repository).

This will take some time, but when working on your workstation you don't need to pull everytime (only when you change one of the PSDepend definition files).

### Pulling Dependencies from PSGallery

Have a look at what is pulled from those files:
- [Modules used during the Build process](./PSDepend.build.psd1)
- [Modules containing the DSC Configurations (DSC Composite Resource)](./PSDepend.DSC_Configurations.psd1)
- [Modules containing the DSC Resources](./PSDepend.DSC_Resources.psd1)

> Note that for this workshop, we have added to git some files directly under the `DSC_Configurations` folder, but that's not a best practice.
> In this `control repository`, you only want to manage trusted artefacts (built in their own pipelines) instead of directly using module sources as we're doing for this demo.

If you are using the full AutomatedLab demo, you can change those PSD1s to use the private repository:
- Register DSCPull01.contoso.com on port 8624 as a the `Internal` PSRepository on the Build Server
- Edit the PSDepend files to add the **Parameter** block and set the `Repository = 'internal'` ([within PSDepend options](https://github.com/gaelcolas/SampleModule/blob/master/PSDepend.build.psd1))
